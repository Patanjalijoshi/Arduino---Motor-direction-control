# Arduino---Motor-direction-control
This project deals with controlling the direction of rotation of a DC motor

## Motor-direction-control
In this project a 2 channel relay is used to control the direction and state of operation of a DC motor. The serial monitor is used to send commands to the Arduino mega to trun the motor clockwise, anti-clockwise or turn it off.   



### Components used:
* Arduino Mega 2560 (The code will be compatable with the Arduino uno as well)
* DC motor
* 2 channel relay  
* 12 volt DC power suppily

### Code details:
The code is written in C and the Arduino IDE is used to compile and write code on to the Arduino Mega 2560
